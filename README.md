# Devlog Entry - 11/19/2023
## Introducing the team
Abraham Halim - **Tools Lead**  
Jimmy Nguyen - **Engine Lead**  
Madison Li - **Design Assistant**  
Josh Levano - **Design Lead**  
Pehara Vidanagamachchi -  **Engine Assistant**

## Tools and materials
**Engines:** Vite + Web Broswer  
    We chose to use a web browser, since all our group members would have experience working with Vite over the course of the quarter. Vite is also lightweight, so it won't take too much of a strain on our computers, especially compared to programs like Unity. 
    
**Languages:** TypeScript  
    Similarly, we are using TypeScript since we've built up experience with it through this class.  
    
**Tools:** Prettier, ESLint, Clip Studio Paint Pro, Photoshop  
    Again, we're hoping to focus on tools that all or most of us have experience with. Prettier and EsLint we've been using in class, and Clip Studio Paint Pro and Photoshop are art programs that our Designers are familiar with.  

## Outlook
**What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?**  
We're hoping to make a peaceful version of Plants vs. Zombies, where the focus is on growing plants that can help bolster other nearby plants. Certain tasks will need preconditions to be able to perform, such as collecting water to water plants. We can also "craft" by merging disparate plants into new plants. End goal of the game is to collect as many new plants as possible without killing all your plants.  

**What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?**  
The stretch goals and the changing requirements seem to be the hardest/riskiest parts. The changing requirements are risky since we can't anticipate what the changes will be, and the stretch goals are by definition, a stretch beyond the basic requirements, and will depend on the time we have remaining after the satisfy initial requirements. The spatial awareness also seems challenging since it requires different cells to interact with one another, which may be complex depending on how our grid is set up.  

**What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?**  
We're hoping to learn refactoring, especially with the changing requirements, and to -- as a result -- learn more SOLID principles of software design.
