## Introducing the team

Jimmy Nguyen - **Engine Lead**  
Madison Li - **Design Assistant**  
Josh Levano - **Design Lead**  
Pehara Vidanagamachchi -  **Engine Assistant**

## Tools and materials
**Engines:** Vite + Web Broswer  
    We chose to use a web browser, since all our group members would have experience working with Vite over the course of the quarter. Vite is also lightweight, so it won't take too much of a strain on our computers, especially compared to programs like Unity. So in short we chose our libraries, engines and platforms just due to personal convinience and not due to how they may be tailored to the task at hand, granted we did think of using some old code we did for this course to help expeidite development on this F0 assignment. If it does work out to be a solid base, wonderful. If not that's unfortante but we are certain that we should be able to make this work out somehow someway with the tools relative usefulness and flexibility. 
    
    
**Languages:** TypeScript  
    The reason we went for a web dev style engine and typescript as the langauge due to all parties having a fair amount of familiarity with the tools used. Also all of these tools we've selected are not only readily available but are also not too intesive on space or computation for our machines. So by extention we're really only using typscript and html. Again this is mainly due to the group's general comfort and shared familiarity with the not exactly the languages but the frameworks they are built upon. Again, there is some consideration given to prexisting projects to salvage. 
    
**Tools:** Prettier, ESLint, Clip Studio Paint Pro, Photoshop  
    The tools we will use will be vscode, clip studio paint and photoshop. Vscode is due to it's incredibly helpful plugins and other cool components. clip studio and photoshop due to the artists personal preferences. Everyone is fairly familiar with vscode and would prefer not to learn new things if we can avoid it. Also vscode has some cool plugins that allow for easy cleanup and quick debugging which is rather helpful for development. So again, it's just due to personal preference and that preference comes from familiarity instead of the tools being tailor picked for the task at hand. 

## Outlook
**What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?**  
We're hoping to make a peaceful version of Plants vs. Zombies, where the focus is on growing plants that can help bolster other nearby plants. Certain tasks will need preconditions to be able to perform, such as collecting water to water plants. We can also "craft" by merging disparate plants into new plants. End goal of the game is to collect as many new plants as possible without killing all your plants.  

**What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?**  
The stretch goals and the changing requirements seem to be the hardest/riskiest parts. The changing requirements are risky since we can't anticipate what the changes will be, and the stretch goals are by definition, a stretch beyond the basic requirements, and will depend on the time we have remaining after we satisfy the initial requirements. The spatial awareness also seems challenging since it requires different cells to interact with one another, which may be complex depending on how our grid is set up.  

**What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?**  
We're hoping to learn refactoring, especially with the changing requirements, and to -- as a result -- learn more SOLID principles of software design.
