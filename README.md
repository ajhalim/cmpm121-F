# Devlog Entry - [date]
## Introducing the team
Abraham Halim - **Tools Lead**
Jimmy Nguyen - **Engine Lead**
Madison Li - **Design Assistant**
Josh Levano - **Design Lead**
Pehara Vidanagamachchi - 
## Tools and materials
Engines: Vite + Web Broswer
Languages: TypeScript
Tools: Prettier, ESLint, 


    Tell us about what engines, libraries, frameworks, and or platforms you intend to use, and give us a tiny bit of detail about why your team chose those.
    Tell us programming languages (e.g. TypeScript) and data languages (e.g. JSON) you team expects to use and why you chose them. Presumably youâ€™ll just be 
      using the languages expected by your previously chosen engine/platform.
    Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual 
      assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.

## Outlook

Give us a short section on your outlook on the project. You might cover one or more of these topics:

    What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?
    What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
    What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?
